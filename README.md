# 👋 Hey, I'm Owen

### About Me
I’m a **Computer Science and Business student** at Western University and the Ivey Business School.  
My interests lie in **AI and its applications in healthcare and education**, particularly in how voice technology can make these systems more accessible and human-centered.  

I’ve worked in **AI strategy consulting** at KPMG and BCG, hosted the *Western AI Podcast* where I interviewed leaders from OpenAI and Anthropic, and built projects that have won several hackathons across Canada.  

Most recently, I’ve been working on **[LiveMock.ai](https://livemock.ai/)** — a real-time interview simulator that helps students practice consulting case interviews.
